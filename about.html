        <h2>About Greyfell Studios</h2>
        <p>
          Greyfell Studios is a small, independent game development studio focused on
          crafting rich worlds, emotional stories, and cooperative gameplay experiences
          that bring players together.
        </p>

    <!-- STUDIO OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="about-overview" style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:24px 5%; padding:22px; border-radius:6px;">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Greyfell Studios started as a passion project: the idea that games could be more
        than just quick matches and checklists. We believe games should feel like worlds
        you can live in—places where stories matter, choices have weight, and the people
        you play with become part of the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus is on cooperative, session-based games that mix tight gameplay with
        atmosphere and narrative. Every system we design—movement, combat, progression,
        or world-building—is meant to support that feeling of exploring something bigger
        together.
      </p>

    <!-- MISSION & VISION -->
    <section id="mission-vision" style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:24px 5%; padding:22px; border-radius:6px;">
      <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To craft imaginative, emotionally grounded game worlds where every player feels
        connected to the story, their teammates, and the community around them.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        We want Greyfell Studios to be known as a studio that delivers unforgettable
        cooperative experiences—games that people remember not just for the mechanics,
        but for the memories they made playing them with friends.
      </p>

    <!-- ORIGINS / STORY -->
    <section id="origins" style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:24px 5%; padding:22px; border-radius:6px;">
      <h2>How Greyfell Began</h2>
      <p>
        Greyfell started with a simple idea: build the kind of games we always wished
        existed when we stayed up late playing with friends. After experimenting with
        prototypes, game jams, and early concepts, the studio’s first major project,
        <strong>Project Cobalt</strong>, began to take shape—a co-op survival experience
        set on mysterious, storm-battered islands.
      </p>
      <p>
        From early paper sketches and concept art to working in Unreal Engine, the goal
        has stayed the same: combine tight gameplay with strong themes, striking art,
        and a world players want to come back to.
      </p>

    <!-- VALUES -->
    <section id="values" style="background-color:#ffffff; margin:24px 5%; padding:22px; border-radius:6px;">
      <h2>What We Value</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Player First:</strong> Games are built for the people who play them, not just for trends or algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooperative Play:</strong> We design around teamwork, communication, and shared victories.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for Time:</strong> Our games aim to be rewarding whether you have 30 minutes or three hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent Development:</strong> We believe in sharing progress, challenges, and wins with the community.</li>
      </ul>
